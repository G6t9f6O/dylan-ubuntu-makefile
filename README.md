# dylan-ubuntu-makefile
A makefile I use to install many of the applications I use on Ubuntu 18.04. Mostly used for rapidly reinstalling daily builds and new systems

### Usage

While this is created to meet my own needs, it may prove useful to others, so I am sharing it publicly. To run this, copy and paste into a terminal:

``` bash
sudo apt -y install git make ; git clone https://github.com/dylanmtaylor/dylan-ubuntu-makefile.git ; cd dylan-ubuntu-makefile ; make
```
